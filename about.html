        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Auto-Man Driving School has been helping learners in Geelong and surrounding suburbs gain their driving 
          independence with confidence. Our mission is to provide high-quality, patient, and personalised driving 
          instruction that prepares students not just to pass their test, but to become safe, confident drivers for life.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          We understand that learning to drive can be both exciting and nerve-wracking. That's why we focus on creating 
          a supportive, pressure-free environment where students can learn at their own pace.
